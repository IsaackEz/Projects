# REQUIREMENTS
- numpy library
- Download MetodoSimplex.py
# HOW TO USE:
Use "Tabla" to fill yours, if you are dealing with MAXIMIZATION you need to put the restrictions as your problem.
If the restriccion is >= on maximization then you need to multiply it by -1 in order to change the simbol to <=.

If the problem is MINIMIZATION then you need to transpose the table. (The rows become columns and vice versa). Then you can fill
the table same as MAX.

Once your table is finished, you can run the program.
This will ask you Min o Max: (MINIMIZATION or MAXIMIZATION) You need to answer: "Max" or "max" or "Min" or "min".
Then it will ask you how many variables your problem have. Once you done this. The program will give you the results.

# NOTES:
- If you are doing minimization, the variables X1, X2, X3, X4... Xn will be backwards. X1 will be X4, X2 will be X3... and on. 
ONLY IN MINIMIZATION.
